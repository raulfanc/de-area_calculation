- **Data Extraction**: The data source for this challenge can vary. The application should be able to ingest JSON data from different sources, including:
    - Direct API calls
    - Loading JSON files from an S3 bucket
- **API Interactions**: In case of API-based data ingestion, the application should:
    - Handle API rate limiting, possibly incorporating a back-off and retry strategy.
    - Implement robust error handling for HTTP error statuses, network errors, timeouts, etc.
    - Handle possible API versioning and data format changes.
    - Manage authentication protocols if required.
    - Deal with possible pagination of API data.
    - Implement a strategy to ensure data consistency amidst frequent data updates.
- **Data Quality & Validation**: The application should implement data quality checks to handle missing or incorrect values in the JSON data. It should also validate the structure of the JSON data and handle nested structures if necessary.
    
- **Parallel Processing**: The application should support parallel processing where applicable, to optimize the ingestion and computation tasks.
    
- **Modularity & Extensibility**: The architecture of the application should be modular to facilitate easy addition or modification of data sources, error handling procedures, data quality checks, etc.
    
- **Unit Testing**: The application codebase should include a suite of unit tests to ensure the correct functionality of the application.
