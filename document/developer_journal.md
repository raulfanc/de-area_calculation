- **Data Extraction**: The data source for this challenge can vary. The application should be able to ingest JSON data from different sources, including:
    - Direct API calls
    - Loading JSON files from an S3 bucket
- **API Interactions**: In case of API-based data ingestion, the application should:
    - Handle API rate limiting, possibly incorporating a back-off and retry strategy.
    - Implement robust error handling for HTTP error statuses, network errors, timeouts, etc.
    - Handle possible API versioning and data format changes.
    - Manage authentication protocols if required.
    - Deal with possible pagination of API data.
    - Implement a strategy to ensure data consistency amidst frequent data updates.
- **Data Quality & Validation**: The application should implement data quality checks to handle missing or incorrect values in the JSON data. It should also validate the structure of the JSON data and handle nested structures if necessary.
    
- **Parallel Processing**: The application should support parallel processing where applicable, to optimize the ingestion and computation tasks.
    
- **Modularity & Extensibility**: The architecture of the application should be modular to facilitate easy addition or modification of data sources, error handling procedures, data quality checks, etc.
    
- **Unit Testing**: The application codebase should include a suite of unit tests to ensure the correct functionality of the application.

1. Understand the Problem and Requirements:

    Go through the problem statement and requirements carefully.
    Understand the inputs, expected outputs, and the key processes involved.

2. Initial Setup:

    Set up your local development environment with the necessary dependencies and libraries like Python, PySpark, Prefect, etc.
    Initialize a Git repository for version control.

3. Implement Core Functionality:

    Start with the development of the core functionality â€“ the calculation of the area of different shapes based on the data in the JSON objects. Write Python functions for this.

4. JSON Input Parsing and Validation:

    Implement functionality to read, parse and validate JSON data. Validation could include checking for necessary keys and the right data types. Create a function that accepts a JSON object, validates it, and then applies the correct area calculation based on the shape type. Test this functionality with hard-coded JSON data.

5. Handle Different Shape Types:

    Develop functions to calculate the area of different shapes, and integrate them into your existing code. This would involve mapping shape types to the appropriate calculation functions.

6. Develop Data Ingestion Functionality:

    Now consider the upstream data sources. Create a data ingestion mechanism to fetch JSON data from different sources, such as API calls and AWS S3.

7. Develop Error Handling Mechanisms:

    Implement error handling to manage exceptions and irregularities in your data, like missing keys or unexpected values.

8. Develop Unit Tests:

    Write unit tests to ensure that your functions are performing as expected. You can use a library like pytest for this.

9. Integrate with Prefect:

    After the individual components are working as expected, create a Prefect flow to manage your data pipeline. This should include tasks for data extraction, data processing, and calculating the total area.

10. Implement Parallel Processing:

    Depending on the scale of data, you might need to implement parallel processing to manage your workloads. This can be achieved through PySpark or even Prefect's capabilities.

11. Documentation and Code Review:

    Document your code, functions, and the Prefect flow.
    Review the code for any refactoring opportunities to improve performance or maintainability.

12. Final Testing:

    Test your complete solution with different datasets and edge cases.

13. Version Control and Deployment:

    Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed to the Git repository.
    Depending on the requirements, the final step would be to deploy your solution to a suitable environment.
