# validation for jsonline
change name of the `shape_management.py` into `json_val.py` since this is a validation module
- check shape: 3 shapes but it is future 
- check key: no extra added key, and only supported key, no n/a
- check value: no extra value, no wrong data type (float and int only), no nagative value, no n/a

```bash
python -m src.v4.area_cal_val
```
