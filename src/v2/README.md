# core function improvement
modularize this code into two parts: 
- managing shapes (shape definitions and a factory for creating them)
- calculating the total area from JSON data.
- run the code from the command line from home directory, treat it as a module not a python file

```bash
python -m src.v2.area_calculation
```
